# Purkinje_Cell_Linear_Density


1)  Make and edit the binary Purkinje cell layer using **Make Binaries IHC** (for tissue sections stained with chromogenic markers) or **Make Binaries IF** (for tissue sections stained with fluorescent markers).
2)  Measure the Purkinje cell layer length of the binaries from step 1 using **Measure Binaries**.
